# Run_analysis.R

This is the main script that is called to performed the cleaning and tidying of the dataset as described in the excercise and listed below.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This file assumes that datazip file has been downloaded and unzipped.

# Run_analysis_util.R

This is supporting script, which provides the helper functions to the main script. This script mainly provides functions to read data from the files.

 * join_data
    - Takes names of 2 data files with similar variables and return the row-combined dataset 
 * get_feature_cols_means_std
    - It takes features file name as input, filters the feature names for "mean"" and "std"" and returns filtered column numbers and tidy names
 * get_activity_names
    - Reads the file that contains activity names and number mapping
